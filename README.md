Intro to a connection between devices within a corporate office. 

This is a blueprint of available switches and routers that help route a connection between each computer in different areas/departments.

Isolated each department with their own subnets and ensured a connection via OSPF. Originally connected each host and device via static routes, however, implemented the OSPF protocol as it is widely used. 

In each interface connection between a router and switch, I have configured GigabitEthernet; configured host connections via FastEthernet.

Updates for more configurations in future repositories.
